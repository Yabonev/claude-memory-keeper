# .claude Folder System Editing Guide

## Overview
This document provides comprehensive best practices for editing ANY part of the .claude folder system. Based on extensive real-world usage, it ensures system integrity and proper evolution.

## Pre-Edit Validation Checklist

### üîç System Understanding Check
Before editing ANYTHING in .claude/, verify:
- [ ] You understand the complete folder structure using `LS .claude/`
- [ ] You've read all existing CLAUDE.md files to understand current state
- [ ] You understand the integration flow between all components
- [ ] You've identified which specific component needs modification

### üìã Current State Assessment
- [ ] Read `.claude/CLAUDE.md` to understand system integration
- [ ] Check if `project_knowledge.md` exists (create from template if missing)
- [ ] Verify all file paths are explicit (`.claude/subfolder/file`)
- [ ] Confirm USER approval for any changes to sub-agent outputs

### üéØ Change Scope Definition
- [ ] Clearly define what you're changing and why
- [ ] Identify which other components might be affected
- [ ] Plan updates to maintain cross-component consistency
- [ ] Determine if CLAUDE.md files need updates

### üîç Cross-Reference Analysis (CRITICAL)
**Before making ANY change, search for ALL related references:**

```bash
# Search for key concepts related to your change
grep -r "keyword" /path/to/project --include="*.md"
grep -r "old_concept" /path/to/project --include="*.md"
grep -r "file_name" /path/to/project --include="*.md"

# Find all files that mention related concepts
grep -r "conversation" . --include="*.md" | grep -v ".git"
grep -r "metadata" . --include="*.md" | grep -v ".git"
grep -r "tracking" . --include="*.md" | grep -v ".git"
```

**Map ALL files that need updating:**
- [ ] `.claude/` folder files (primary changes)
- [ ] `README.md` (documentation updates)
- [ ] Root `CLAUDE.md` (if structure/workflow changes)
- [ ] Any examples or references in other files
- [ ] Any file path references that change

## Editing Rules & Best Practices

### üö´ Absolute Rules (NEVER Break These)
1. **Maintain Leanness**: Keep all CLAUDE.md files under 20-35 lines
2. **Use Explicit Paths**: Always use `.claude/subfolder/filename` - never ambiguous references
3. **Preserve Hierarchy**: Root (project) ‚Üí .claude/ (integration) ‚Üí subfolders (specialized)
4. **No Duplication**: Each CLAUDE.md has unique purpose, no content overlap
5. **Self-Reference**: This file must document its own editing procedures

### ‚úÖ Quality Standards
- **CLAUDE.md Format**: Purpose ‚Üí Files ‚Üí Usage (each under 20 lines)
- **Knowledge Entries**: Include "When was this created" with collaboration context
- **File References**: Complete paths, never relative or ambiguous
- **Integration Updates**: Update `.claude/CLAUDE.md` when adding/removing components

### üîÑ Cross-Component Consistency
- **Terminology**: Use USER/AI consistently across all files
- **Reference Codes**: Use descriptive codes that reflect actual content
- **Use Case Tags**: Apply [RESEARCH], [IMPLEMENT], [REFACTOR], etc. consistently
- **Path Standards**: All file references use complete `.claude/subfolder/file` format

## Component-Specific Editing Guidelines

### ai_history/ Component
**When to Edit:**
- USER provides feedback requiring knowledge base updates
- New patterns or workflows discovered during collaboration
- Template needs customization for specific project

**Editing Steps:**
1. Check if `project_knowledge.md` exists (create from `core/project_knowledge_template.md`)
2. Add new knowledge with descriptive reference codes
3. Include "When was this created" context
4. Update conversation folders for significant exchanges
   - Create `metadata.md` from `core/conversation_metadata_template.md`
   - **Capture complete context**: Files, decisions, searches, insights, problems, solutions
   - **Document reasoning**: Why decisions were made, alternatives considered
   - **Track current state**: What's working, what's not, next critical steps
   - **Enable instant continuation**: Everything needed for seamless conversation pickup
5. Log knowledge usage in usage log

### claude_code/ Component
**When to Edit:**
- Tool usage patterns change or improve
- New best practices discovered through actual usage
- Model capabilities or configuration updates needed

**Editing Steps:**
1. Update `settings.md` with new tool guidance
2. Modify `claude_md_principles.md` if hierarchy patterns change
3. Adjust `CLAUDE.md` for new usage patterns
4. Update `../settings.json` for configuration changes

### commands/ Component
**When to Edit:**
- New custom slash commands created
- Workflow documentation needs updates
- System maintenance procedures change

**Editing Steps:**
1. Add new `.md` files for custom commands
2. Update `CLAUDE.md` to reference new commands
3. Modify this file (`edit_claude_system.md`) for procedure changes
4. Document command usage patterns

### sub-agent-tasks/ Component
**When to Edit:**
- Files are auto-generated, generally READ-ONLY
- Only edit `CLAUDE.md` if usage patterns change
- Require USER approval before using outputs as foundation

## Validation Workflow

### üîß Pre-Edit Validation
```bash
# Verify structure
LS .claude/

# Check integration
Read .claude/CLAUDE.md

# Understand current state
Read [component]/CLAUDE.md
```

### ‚úèÔ∏è During Editing
1. **Maintain explicit paths**: Use `.claude/subfolder/file` format
2. **Preserve integration**: Update `.claude/CLAUDE.md` if adding/removing components
3. **Follow CLAUDE.md patterns**: Purpose ‚Üí Files ‚Üí Usage format
4. **Document changes**: Add knowledge entries for significant modifications

### üîÑ Recursive Cross-Reference Updating (MANDATORY)
**For EVERY change made, update ALL related references systematically:**

1. **Update primary files** (`.claude/` folder)
2. **Update documentation** (`README.md`, root `CLAUDE.md`)
3. **Update examples and references** (search results from pre-edit analysis)
4. **Update file path references** (if folder structure changes)
5. **Update workflow descriptions** (if process changes)

**Example: Adding metadata system requires updating:**
- [ ] `ai_history/core/` (new template file)
- [ ] `ai_history/CLAUDE.md` (reference new template)
- [ ] `tracking_instructions.md` (workflow updates)
- [ ] `edit_claude_system.md` (editing guidelines)
- [ ] `README.md` ("What Gets Saved", "How to Continue")
- [ ] Any examples showing folder structure
- [ ] Any workflow descriptions

### ‚úÖ Post-Edit Validation
**System Integrity:**
- [ ] All CLAUDE.md files remain under length limits (20-35 lines)
- [ ] All file references use explicit paths
- [ ] Integration hub (`.claude/CLAUDE.md`) reflects current structure
- [ ] No content duplication between CLAUDE.md files
- [ ] Cross-component consistency maintained

**Cross-Reference Validation (CRITICAL):**
- [ ] **Re-run search commands** to verify ALL references were updated
- [ ] **Check README.md** for consistency with .claude/ folder changes
- [ ] **Verify root CLAUDE.md** reflects any structural/workflow changes
- [ ] **Validate examples** show current folder structure and processes
- [ ] **Test workflow descriptions** match actual implementation

**Validation Commands:**
```bash
# Verify no old references remain
grep -r "old_concept" . --include="*.md" | grep -v ".git"

# Check for broken file path references
grep -r "claude/" . --include="*.md" | grep -v ".claude/"

# Ensure all documentation is consistent
grep -r "conversation" . --include="*.md" | grep -v ".git"
grep -r "metadata" . --include="*.md" | grep -v ".git"
```

**Must verify ZERO results for outdated references**

## System Evolution Best Practices

### üìà Continuous Improvement
- **Monitor usage patterns**: Track what works vs. what doesn't
- **Update based on feedback**: USER corrections become system improvements
- **Evolve with projects**: Adapt templates for specific project needs
- **Document lessons learned**: Capture insights for future use

### üîÑ Template Maintenance
- **Keep core templates clean**: Don't pollute with project-specific content
- **Update procedures**: Refine editing processes based on actual usage
- **Maintain universality**: Ensure patterns work for any project type
- **Version control changes**: Track significant system modifications

### ü§ù Collaboration Principles
- **USER approval required**: For any significant system changes
- **Transparent process**: Explain what you're changing and why
- **Reversible changes**: Maintain ability to undo modifications
- **Knowledge preservation**: Don't lose valuable accumulated knowledge

## Emergency Recovery Procedures

### üö® If System Becomes Inconsistent
1. **Stop all edits** until structure is repaired
2. **Use `LS .claude/` to assess damage**
3. **Restore from known good patterns** using this guide
4. **Rebuild integration hub** (`.claude/CLAUDE.md`) with correct @ imports
5. **Validate all CLAUDE.md files** follow proper format

### üîß Common Issues & Fixes
- **Ambiguous file references**: Replace with explicit `.claude/subfolder/file` paths
- **CLAUDE.md too long**: Split into Purpose ‚Üí Files ‚Üí Usage, remove duplication
- **Missing integration**: Add component to `.claude/CLAUDE.md` Active Components
- **Lost knowledge**: Recover from conversation history or knowledge usage logs
- **Incomplete cross-reference updates**: README.md or other docs don't reflect .claude/ changes
- **Outdated examples**: Folder structure examples show old organization
- **Broken workflow descriptions**: Documentation doesn't match actual implementation

### üéØ Lessons Learned: Metadata System Addition
**What went wrong initially:**
- Added conversation metadata to .claude/ folder but didn't update README.md
- Changed concepts from "file tracking" to "context capture" but missed related references
- Updated folder structure but didn't search for all examples that needed updating

**What should have been done:**
1. Pre-edit search: `grep -r "conversation\|metadata\|tracking" . --include="*.md"`
2. Systematic updating: All files with related concepts updated together
3. Post-edit validation: Verified all references were consistent
4. Cross-reference checking: Ensured README.md matched .claude/ folder changes
