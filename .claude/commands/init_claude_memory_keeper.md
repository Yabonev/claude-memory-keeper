# Initialize Claude Memory Keeper System

## Your Task
You are activating the Claude Memory Keeper system. This command loads the complete template structure into your memory and establishes the intelligent workflow system.

## Step 1: Load Core System Files
Read and understand these essential files:

**System Integration:**
- @.claude/CLAUDE.md
- @.claude/ai_history/CLAUDE.md  
- @.claude/claude_code/CLAUDE.md
- @.claude/commands/CLAUDE.md
- @.claude/sub-agent-tasks/CLAUDE.md

**Core Templates & Instructions:**
- @.claude/ai_history/core/tracking_instructions.md
- @.claude/ai_history/core/project_knowledge_template.md
- @.claude/claude_code/claude_md_principles.md
- @.claude/claude_code/settings.md

**Configuration:**
- @.claude/settings.json

## Step 2: System Understanding Verification
After reading all files, state your understanding:

**Template Structure:**
- Explain the hierarchy: Root → .claude/ → subfolders
- Describe each subfolder's purpose and key files
- Confirm the integration flow between components

**Key Capabilities:**
- Context-aware knowledge management with reference codes
- Strategic delegation with sub-agent task outputs
- Custom slash command automation
- Living memory evolution through usage

**Operational Principles:**
- "Context is King" - comprehensive context gathering before execution
- Lean CLAUDE.md design (20-35 lines max)
- Explicit file paths always (`.claude/subfolder/file`)
- User approval required for sub-agent output usage

## Step 3: System Activation
Confirm you understand:
- How to create `project_knowledge.md` from template when needed
- When and how to save conversations in `conversations/` folders
- How to use reference codes and context evaluation
- Strategic delegation patterns with structured outputs
- Cross-component integration workflows

## Step 4: Project Discovery Protocol
Since this is a template system, immediately begin:
1. Ask USER about their project's main purpose and goals
2. Determine if this is template setup or active project work
3. Update root CLAUDE.md with project-specific context if needed
4. Begin applying the memory keeper system to their actual work

## Expected Response Format
```
## System Loading Complete ✅

**Template Structure Understood:**
[Explain the hierarchy and component purposes]

**Key Capabilities Activated:**
[List the main system features you'll now use]

**Operational Principles Confirmed:**
[State the core principles you'll follow]

**Ready for Project Discovery:**
What is the main purpose and goals of this project? I'll adapt the memory keeper system to your specific needs and begin intelligent collaboration.
```

## Success Criteria
- All core files loaded and understood
- System hierarchy and integration clear
- Operational principles confirmed
- Ready to adapt template to specific project needs
- Intelligent workflow patterns activated
