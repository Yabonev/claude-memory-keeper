# Sub-Agent Task Outputs

## Purpose
Auto-generated storage for Agent tool delegation outputs. This folder contains historical records of sub-agent work for context and reference.

## Files
- **`task-{ID}-{description}.md`**: Auto-generated outputs from Agent tool delegations with structured results and context

## Usage
- **Read-only context**: Use existing files for understanding previous sub-agent work
- **Auto-generated content**: Files are created automatically by AI agents using Agent tool
- **Require user approval**: Always ask USER before referencing or building upon sub-agent outputs
- **Historical reference**: Provides audit trail of delegated work and parallel execution patterns

## Important Notes
- **Do not edit manually**: Files are auto-generated and should remain as historical records
- **Context only**: Use for understanding what was previously delegated and accomplished
- **User approval required**: Always confirm with USER before using sub-agent outputs as foundation for new work
- **Parallel execution tracking**: Shows how complex tasks were broken down and executed in parallel
