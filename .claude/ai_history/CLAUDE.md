# AI History & Memory Management

## Purpose

Context-aware conversation tracking and knowledge management with coded references and multi-context support.

## Files

- **`project_knowledge.md`**: Living knowledge base with coded entries, usage logs, and context tags (created from core/template when work begins)
- **`core/project_knowledge_template.md`**: Template for creating project_knowledge.md
- **`core/tracking_instructions.md`**: Core protocol for conversation tracking and knowledge management
- **`conversations/conversation_XXX/`**: Individual session folders with conversation history

## Usage

- **Create `project_knowledge.md`**: Copy from `core/project_knowledge_template.md` when starting work
- **Always check `project_knowledge.md`**: Before starting significant work
- **Create contextual reference codes**: Use descriptive codes for knowledge entries
- **Log knowledge usage**: Record what was accessed and when in usage logs
- **Evaluate relevance**: Ask "Is [KNOWLEDGE_CODE] relevant to my current [USE_CASE]?"
- **Save conversations**: Create new conversation_XXX folders for session tracking
