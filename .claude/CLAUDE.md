# System Integration Hub

## Purpose
Coordinates all .claude folder components to work together as an active intelligence enhancement system.

## Active Components
- **ai_history/**: @.claude/ai_history/CLAUDE.md
- **claude_code/**: @.claude/claude_code/CLAUDE.md  
- **commands/**: @.claude/commands/CLAUDE.md
- **sub-agent-tasks/**: @.claude/sub-agent-tasks/CLAUDE.md

## Integration Protocol
Every session must actively use ALL components:

### Knowledge → Tools → Commands Flow
1. **Check existing knowledge** before starting work
2. **Apply tool optimization** during execution
3. **Create automation commands** for repeated patterns
4. **Update knowledge base** with discoveries

### Cross-Component Behaviors
- **Save conversations**: ai_history tracks all significant exchanges
- **Optimize workflows**: claude_code patterns guide tool usage
- **Delegate strategically**: sub-agent-tasks stores parallel execution outputs
- **Automate repetition**: commands folder stores custom slash commands
- **Evolve intelligently**: Each component learns from the others

## System Questions
ALWAYS consider during work:
- "Should this be saved as knowledge?"
- "Can this be automated with a command?"
- "Is there relevant knowledge to apply?"
- "Can I delegate part of this for parallel execution?"
- "Should I check sub-agent outputs for context before proceeding?"
